For the rest of this year, I want to have 2 posts made per month.
Due on the 1st and the 15th of every month.
The goal of this is to train on increasingly complex topics in regards to Reverse Engineering.
Starting with simple assembly code reading and working my way up to involving hardware.

I currently have no specific or measureable portion of this goal, but I hope that will come as I learn more about RE.
